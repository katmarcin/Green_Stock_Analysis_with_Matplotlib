# Green_Stock_Analysis_with_Matplotlib

Personal Project: Using Python and Matplotlib to produce a comprehensive data analysis on three energy-producer companies for September 2022. This analysis showcases the performance of each respective company's stock: Ameresco (AMRC), ON Semiconductor Corp (ON), and Stem,Inc. (STEM). Data visualizations are created from this stock analysis to help investors or traders making buying or selling decisions, thereby gaining an edge in the markets.

Besides delivering financial news and reports, Yahoo Finance also provides current and historical stock information that data analysts can extract via Pythonic code and perform analyses directly in their coding environments. Over a dozen data visualizations are created for this stock analysis by manipulating different stock metrics i.e. daily percentage change, cumulative return.

Ameresco is a renewable energy and energy efficiency company. Ameresco's portfolio consists of asset sustianability, renewable energy solutions, and infrastructure upgrades serving clients in North America and in Europe. Ameresco's project span from federal governemnt buildings, airports to hospitals and schools/ Ameresco focuses on building energy infrastructure and development. Ameresco also helps customers with financial operating solutions for establishing energy efficiency and renewable energy infrastructure.
* AMRC stood out to me as a company to invest in because of its strong energy sales in the past year, making it a top-performing stock in the energy sector. Sales soared 111% last quarter and its stock continues to rise.
